## What is Uniblock?

Uniblock is an AI-powered routing layer for Web3. For every request, Uniblock selects the best upstream provider based on reliability, cost, and performance — with automatic retries and failover to help keep your calls from failing.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title='Smart provider routing' icon='shuffle'>
    Automatically routes requests to the best provider per chain and method.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Automatic retries' icon='arrows-rotate'>
    Retries transient failures so your requests are more resilient.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Failover & fallback' icon='life-ring'>
    Falls back to alternate providers when an upstream is degraded.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## APIs

Choose the API style that best matches what you’re building.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Unified JSON-RPC"
    icon="terminal"
    href="ref:overview"
  >
    The foundation for blockchain interaction — one endpoint for JSON-RPC across hundreds of chains.
  </Card>

{' '}
<Card title='Unified APIs' icon='layer-group' href='ref:token'>
  Higher-level endpoints for common data needs like tokens, NFTs, transactions,
  and market data.
</Card>

  <Card
    title="Direct Provider APIs"
    icon="plug"
    href="ref:overview-direct-api"
  >
    Provider-specific methods when you need an endpoint that isn’t available in Unified APIs.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Unified JSON-RPC

Use Unified JSON-RPC when you want maximum compatibility with existing tooling and standard blockchain methods.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title='JSON-RPC reference' icon='book' href='ref:overview'>
    Browse supported methods, request/response formats, and examples.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title='Supported methods by chain'
    icon='link'
    href='doc:supported-methods-by-chain'
  >
    See which JSON-RPC methods are supported on each chain.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Unified APIs

Use Unified APIs when you want higher-level, easier-to-use endpoints for common workflows without stitching together raw JSON-RPC calls.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title='Token API' icon='coins' href='ref:token'>
    Token metadata, balances, and contract-related token data.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Market Data API' icon='chart-line' href='ref:market-data'>
    Pricing and market data endpoints to power dashboards and analytics.
  </Card>
  <Card title='NFT API' icon='images' href='ref:nft-1'>
    NFT collections, assets, and related NFT metadata.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title='Transaction API'
    icon='arrow-right-arrow-left'
    href='ref:transaction'
  >
    Transaction lookups and transaction-related data.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Scan API' icon='magnifying-glass' href='ref:scan'>
    Chain scanning and explorer-style access patterns.
  </Card>
  <Card title='Webhook API' icon='bell' href='ref:webhook'>
    Event-driven updates so you don’t have to poll.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Direct Provider APIs

Direct APIs give you access to provider-specific endpoints exactly as offered by the upstream provider. Use this when you need a method that isn’t yet abstracted into Uniblock’s Unified APIs.

<Card
  title='Browse Direct APIs'
  icon='plug'
  href='ref:overview-direct-api'
  horizontal
>
  Find provider-specific methods and quickly integrate them into your app.
</Card>
