# 🦉Introduction

Uniblock provides a gateway to the world of Web3 technologies. We have developed a unified Web3 API that streamlines the interaction with multiple protocols and blockchain networks. This simplification allows both seasoned and novice developers to integrate decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain data with ease.

We have created a single structure for endpoints. Regardless of what and where your blockchain data comes from no additional boilerplate code or data parsing is required.

We cover a wide range of API endpoints including,

- Blockchain Data - Tokens, NFTs, Historical Data, Transfers, Collections, Metadata, etc.
- Market Data - Market Cap, Volume, History, Charting Data, Trending, Price, etc.
- Scans Data - Transactions, Transfers. Price, etc.
- JSON/RPC Data - Gas, Block, Transaction, Global, etc.

Additionally, we provide a Launcher to simplify smart contract deployments. It breaks down smart contracts between Uniblock and other providers, offering a seamless user experience. Start creating your first smart contracts with Uniblock!

## 🛣️ Auto Routing

One of the key features of our API is our Auto Routing product. It has features that automatically routes your API calls to the most suitable providers based on various criteria, ensuring reliability, cost-efficiency, and ease of testing. AutoRoute can save you from needing to obtain multiple API keys from various providers. Just with a Uniblock API key, you are set to access everything in the web3 world that Uniblock integrated providers can reach. Learn more about our [Auto Routing](doc:auto-routing) features here.
