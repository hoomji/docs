### Example

Imagine you have an established relationship with a payment processing provider, with negotiated rates and terms that are beneficial for your business. You can input your own API key for this provider into Uniblock.

You can do so by adding your provider key on Settings -> Integration Page. Once added to your project, you can use your Uniblock key to make the same API requests via Uniblock.

Your API calls for payment processing are then routed through your key, ensuring that you continue to benefit from your negotiated terms while also enjoying the centralized API management features of Uniblock.
