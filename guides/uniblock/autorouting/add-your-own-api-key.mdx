Add your own provider API keys to the Uniblock system, enabling direct routing of your calls through the API keys you bring in. This functionality is designed for users who have pre-existing relationships with service providers and wish to maintain these connections while taking advantage of Uniblock's streamlined API management capabilities. It offers a perfect blend of flexibility and control, allowing for a customized integration experience.

## Key Benefits

- **Customization**: Tailor your API integration to match your specific needs by utilizing your existing API keys, ensuring that your setup remains consistent with your operational requirements.
- **Control**: Maintain complete control over your provider relationships and API usage, making adjustments as necessary to optimize performance and cost.
- **Simplicity**: Simplify the management of your API keys by consolidating them within Uniblock, enabling easy tracking and updates directly from our platform.

### Example

If you have an established relationship with a provider, with negotiated rates and terms that are beneficial for your business. You can input your own API key for this provider into Uniblock.

You can do so by adding your provider key on Settings -> Integration Page. Once added to your project, you can use your Uniblock key to make the same API requests via Uniblock.

Your API calls for payment processing are then routed through your key, ensuring that you continue to benefit from your negotiated terms while also enjoying the centralized API management features of Uniblock.
