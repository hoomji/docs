# What are backup providers?

Backup providers ensure your API calls never fail due to a single provider outage. When your primary provider is unavailable, rate-limited, or returns errors, Uniblock automatically routes requests to backup providers in your configured priority list.

**Use backup providers when you need:**
- 99.99%+ uptime guarantees
- Protection against provider outages
- Automatic rate limit handling
- Zero-downtime failover

<Info>
  Backup providers are enabled by default for all Uniblock users. No configuration required.
</Info>

## How it works

Uniblock maintains a priority list (fallback list) of providers for each endpoint category. When a request fails:

1. **Primary attempt** - Request goes to your top-priority provider
2. **Failure detection** - System detects failure (timeout, rate limit, 5xx error, invalid key)
3. **Automatic failover** - Request immediately routes to next provider in list
4. **Seamless response** - Your application receives the response without knowing a failover occurred

## Fallback list types

### Internal fallback (default)

Uniblock's pre-configured provider list optimized for reliability and cost.

**Characteristics:**
- No setup required
- Enabled by default for all users
- Optimized based on real-time provider performance
- Includes 20+ blockchain data providers
- Automatically updated as provider performance changes

**Example internal fallback list for token balances:**
1. Covalent (lowest cost, high reliability)
2. Moralis (medium cost, high reliability)
3. Alchemy (higher cost, highest reliability)
4. QuickNode (backup)

```bash Using internal fallback (default)
curl --location \
'https://api.uniblock.dev/uni/v1/token/balances?chainId=1&address=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb' \
--header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

If Covalent fails → automatically tries Moralis → then Alchemy → then QuickNode.

### External keys fallback (custom)

Bring your own provider API keys and configure custom priority lists.

**Characteristics:**
- Use your existing provider credits
- Full control over provider priority
- Uniblock auto-routing as final fallback
- Configure different lists per endpoint category

**Example custom fallback list:**
1. Your Alchemy key (primary)
2. Your Infura key (backup)
3. Your QuickNode key (backup)
4. Uniblock auto-routing (final fallback)

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Consume your own provider credits first
- Uniblock provides ultimate reliability as final backup
- Custom routing based on your provider relationships
- Unified management of all provider keys

## Common failure scenarios

### Rate limit exceeded

**Scenario:** Your Alchemy key hits its rate limit (300 requests/second).

**What happens:**
1. Request #301 fails with rate limit error
2. Uniblock detects rate limit response
3. Request automatically routes to Infura (next in list)
4. Your app receives successful response

**Result:** Zero downtime, seamless failover.

### Provider outage

**Scenario:** Infura experiences a service outage.

**What happens:**
1. Request times out after 5 seconds
2. Uniblock detects timeout
3. Request automatically routes to QuickNode
4. Your app receives successful response

**Result:** Your users never notice the outage.

### Invalid API key

**Scenario:** Your provider API key expires or is invalid.

**What happens:**
1. Request fails with 401 authentication error
2. Uniblock detects invalid key
3. Request automatically routes to next provider
4. Dashboard alerts you to update the key

**Result:** Service continues while you fix the key.

### Provider-specific error

**Scenario:** Provider returns 5xx server error.

**What happens:**
1. Request fails with 500 internal server error
2. Uniblock detects server error
3. Request automatically routes to next provider
4. Your app receives successful response

**Result:** Provider issues don't affect your application.

## Configuration example

Here's how a custom fallback list works with your own provider keys:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your provider keys">
    In the [Uniblock dashboard](https://dashboard.uniblock.dev), add your provider API keys:
    - Alchemy: `alch_abc123...`
    - Infura: `infura_xyz789...`
    - QuickNode: `qn_def456...`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure priority list">
    Set your fallback order for token endpoints:
    1. Alchemy (your key)
    2. Infura (your key)
    3. QuickNode (your key)
    4. Uniblock auto-routing (final backup)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make API calls normally">
    ```bash
    curl --location \
    'https://api.uniblock.dev/uni/v1/token/balances?chainId=1&address=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb' \
    --header 'x-api-key: YOUR_UNIBLOCK_KEY'
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic failover">
    If Alchemy fails, Uniblock automatically tries Infura, then QuickNode, then its own provider pool. Your code never changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring and alerts

Track failover events in the Uniblock dashboard:

- **Failover count** - How many times backup providers were used
- **Provider health** - Real-time status of each provider
- **Error breakdown** - Types of failures triggering failovers
- **Cost analysis** - Which providers are being used most

**Alerts available:**
- Provider key expiration warnings
- High failover rate notifications
- Provider performance degradation alerts

---

## Best practices

<Check>
  **Use Uniblock auto-routing as final fallback** - Even with your own provider keys, add Uniblock auto-routing as the last item in your priority list for ultimate reliability.
</Check>

<Check>
  **Configure different lists per endpoint category** - Token endpoints may need different providers than NFT endpoints. Optimize each category separately.
</Check>

<Check>
  **Monitor failover rates** - High failover rates indicate issues with your primary provider. Review and adjust your priority list.
</Check>

<Check>
  **Test your fallback configuration** - Temporarily disable your primary provider to verify failover works as expected.
</Check>

## Common pitfalls

<Warning>
  **Don't rely on a single provider** - Even with backup providers, test your configuration to ensure failover works correctly.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Provider key expiration** - Set up alerts for expiring provider keys. Expired keys trigger unnecessary failovers.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Inconsistent data across providers** - Different providers may return slightly different data formats. Test thoroughly when switching providers.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Cost implications** - Backup providers may have different pricing. Monitor which providers are being used to manage costs effectively.
</Warning>
