# What is auto-routing?

Auto-routing automatically directs your API calls to the best available blockchain data provider based on reliability, cost, and performance. Instead of managing multiple provider keys and handling failovers manually, Uniblock routes requests intelligently and switches providers seamlessly when issues occur.

**Use auto-routing when you need:**
- Guaranteed uptime with automatic failover
- Cost-optimized provider selection
- Multi-provider redundancy without manual configuration
- Verified data accuracy across providers

<Info>
  Auto-routing is enabled by default for all Uniblock API keys. No setup required.
</Info>

## How it works

When you make an API call with your Uniblock key:

1. **Route selection** - Uniblock evaluates available providers for cost and reliability
2. **Primary request** - Your call is routed to the optimal provider
3. **Auto-retry** - If the call fails, it's automatically retried with the same provider
4. **Failover** - After max retries, the request routes to the next best provider
5. **Data verification** - (Pro+ plans) Response data is verified across multiple providers

## Core features

### Default routing

Access all Uniblock-integrated providers with a single API key. No provider selection or configuration required.

**Key benefits:**
- Instant access to 20+ blockchain data providers
- Pre-configured backup provider list
- Works immediately with free tier

[Learn more about default routing →](/guides/uniblock/autorouting/uniblock-default-routing)

### Backup providers

Automatic failover to backup providers when the primary provider is unavailable or rate-limited.

**Key benefits:**
- Zero downtime during provider outages
- Seamless failover without code changes
- Configurable priority list for custom routing

**Example scenario:**
Your app makes 1,000 requests/minute. Your primary provider (Alchemy) hits rate limits at request #500. Auto-routing automatically switches to your backup provider (Infura) for requests #501-1000 without dropping a single call.

### Routing optimization
<Note>Available on Growth plans and above</Note>

Routes requests to the provider offering the best combination of low cost and high reliability.

**Key benefits:**
- Automatic cost optimization across providers
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Dynamic routing based on current conditions

**Example scenario:**
For NFT metadata requests, Provider A costs $0.001/call with 99.9% uptime, while Provider B costs $0.002/call with 99.95% uptime. Routing optimization automatically selects Provider A, saving you 50% on costs while maintaining excellent reliability.

### Auto-retry
<Note>Available on Pro plans and above</Note>

Automatically retries failed requests before switching to backup providers.

**Key benefits:**
- Reduces false failovers from transient errors
- Configurable retry count and intervals
- Intelligent retry logic based on error type

**How it works:**
1. Request fails (timeout, 5xx error, etc.)
2. System waits configured interval (default: 1 second)
3. Retries up to configured limit (default: 3 attempts)
4. If all retries fail, routes to next provider in priority list

### Data consensus
<Note>Available on Pro plans and above</Note>

Verifies response data across multiple providers to ensure accuracy.

**Key benefits:**
- Eliminates incorrect data from single-provider errors
- Detects and filters outlier responses
- Ensures data consistency for critical operations

**Example scenario:**
Your app requests the current ETH price. Data consensus queries 3 providers:
- Provider A: $2,500.00
- Provider B: $2,501.50
- Provider C: $25,000.00 (outlier)

The system detects Provider C's outlier and returns the consensus value of ~$2,500, preventing a critical pricing error.

## Quick example

Auto-routing works transparently with all Uniblock API calls:

```bash Standard API call with auto-routing
curl --location \
'https://api.uniblock.dev/uni/v1/token/balances?chainId=1&address=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb' \
--header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Behind the scenes, Uniblock:
1. Routes to the optimal provider (e.g., Alchemy)
2. If Alchemy fails, retries 3 times
3. If still failing, switches to backup (e.g., Infura)
4. Returns the response seamlessly

**You don't need to change anything in your code.** Auto-routing handles all provider management automatically.

## Configuration options

### Using your own provider keys

Bring your own provider API keys to Uniblock for unified management:

1. Add provider keys in the [Uniblock dashboard](https://dashboard.uniblock.dev)
2. Configure custom priority lists per endpoint category
3. Set Uniblock auto-routing as final fallback

**Benefits:**
- Use existing provider credits
- Custom routing priority
- Uniblock backup for ultimate reliability

</Frame>

### Priority lists

Configure which providers are tried first for different endpoint categories:

- **Token endpoints** - Prioritize Covalent, fallback to Moralis
- **NFT endpoints** - Prioritize Alchemy, fallback to Reservoir
- **Transaction endpoints** - Prioritize Infura, fallback to QuickNode

## Common pitfalls

<Warning>
  **Free tier limitations** - Default routing on the free tier has rate limits suitable for testing only. Upgrade to Growth or higher for production use.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Provider-specific features** - Some provider-specific endpoints may not be available through auto-routing. Use [Direct API](/reference/direct-api/overview-direct-api) for provider-specific features.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Data consensus latency** - Data consensus adds ~100-200ms latency as it queries multiple providers. Only enable for critical data where accuracy is paramount.
</Warning>
