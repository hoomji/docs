Here we go over some of the key benefits of auto routing. This should be enough to help you get a general understanding of what we offer. If you'd like you can read more into each feature or move onto the [Providers](doc:providers) page to learn about our Providers.

# Key Benefits

- [Default Routing](/guides/uniblock//autorouting/uniblock-default-routing): By default, your Uniblock key can access data from all Uniblock-integrated providers, along with a backup provider list, without any setup or subscription.
- [Backup providers](/guides/uniblock/autorouting/uniblock-backup): Ensures uninterrupted service by having backup auto routing to automatically switch to our backup providers through our backup API keys if your primary provider(s) is unavailable.
- [Auto Retry](/guides/uniblock/autorouting/uniblock-auto-retry): In case your calls to a provider fail, we'll verify your call with that provider and attempt to call the provider a set number of times before moving on to the next provider in your priority list.
- [Data Consensus](/guides/uniblock/autorouting/uniblock-data-consensus): Upon receiving response data from providers, we'll verify that information with other providers to ensure its accuracy. Your data will be curated to include exactly the information you want.
- [Routing Optimization](/guides/uniblock/autorouting/uniblock-routing-optimization): We'll route your initial call to the provider offering the cheapest cost and most reliable data.
