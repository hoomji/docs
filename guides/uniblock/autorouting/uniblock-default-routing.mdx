title: 'Default Routing'
description: 'Experiment Unified API and AutoRoute features without needing an API key.'
---

It is supported to call the Unified API endpoints without an API key, so that user can try out the Unified API and its AutoRoute features. No initial setup is required, such as signing up, creating a project or selecting a provider.

Default Routing offers a path to explore and integrate our APIs without the upfront commitment of selecting a plan or provider. This feature is designed to facilitate quick testing and development, allowing users to get a feel for the API's capabilities and how they can fit into various projects. It's an ideal starting point for developers looking to understand the potential and functionality of our services with minimal initial setup.

Note that default routing is not for production. It subjects to rate limits that can be hit easily.

## Key Benefits

- By default, your Uniblock key can access data from all Uniblock-integrated providers, along with a backup provider list, without any setup or subscription.
- Ease of Access: Instantly access our APIs without the need to navigate through the setup of plans or providers, making the initial exploration phase as simple as possible.
- Risk-Free Testing: Experiment with the APIs in a sandbox environment, enabling you to test functionalities and integration capabilities without incurring costs or commitments.
- Rapid Prototyping: Accelerate the development process by allowing developers to quickly prototype and iterate on their ideas, demonstrating the practical applications of our APIs in real-world scenarios.

## Example

To utilize Default Routing, use any method to access our endpoints. Uniblock also provides the following platforms for user to try out:

- [Unified API Reference](/reference/unified-api/overview-unified-apis)
- [Uniblock Explorer](https://explorer.uniblock.dev/)

For instance you can use our Unified API Reference to start calling [/token/balance](/reference//unified-api/api-overview-token) by clicking the big blue `Try it!` button.

You can also select your preferred programming language and directly integrate the endpoint into your application.
