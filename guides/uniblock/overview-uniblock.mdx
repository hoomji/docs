# What Uniblock does

Uniblock is a blockchain infrastructure layer that abstracts away the complexity of working with multiple data providers and chains. Instead of managing dozens of API keys, handling provider outages, and normalizing inconsistent data formats, you get one unified interface that works everywhere.

**Core value proposition:**

- **One API key** replaces 20+ provider integrations
- **Auto-routing** ensures requests always succeed via intelligent failover
- **Normalized data** provides consistent formats across all providers
- **Multi-chain support** for 100+ blockchains with identical API patterns

## How it works

When you make a request to Uniblock:

1. **Request received** - Your API call hits Uniblock's routing layer
2. **Provider selection** - Auto-routing picks the optimal provider based on reliability, latency, and cost
3. **Data retrieval** - Request is sent to the selected provider (e.g., Alchemy, QuickNode, Covalent)
4. **Normalization** - Response is transformed into Uniblock's unified format
5. **Validation** - Data is verified for completeness and accuracy
6. **Failover** - If the provider fails, request automatically retries with backup providers
7. **Response** - You receive consistent, reliable data

```bash Example: Token balance request
curl --location \
'https://api.uniblock.dev/uni/v1/token/balances?chainId=1&address=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb' \
--header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

```json Response: Normalized across all providers
{
  "data": [
    {
      "tokenAddress": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
      "symbol": "USDC",
      "balance": "1000000000",
      "decimals": 6,
      "balanceFormatted": "1000.00",
      "valueUsd": "1000.00"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key features

### Auto-routing

Uniblock automatically routes requests to the best available provider based on real-time performance metrics. If a provider is down or slow, requests instantly failover to backup providers.

**Benefits:**

- **99.9% uptime** - No single point of failure
- **Optimized latency** - Routes to fastest provider for your region
- **Cost efficiency** - Balances requests across providers to minimize costs
- **Zero configuration** - Works automatically, no manual setup required

**How it works:**

- Monitors provider health in real-time
- Tracks latency, error rates, and success rates
- Maintains fallback chains for every endpoint
- Retries failed requests automatically

### Data normalization

Different providers return data in different formats. Uniblock normalizes all responses into a consistent schema, so you never have to write provider-specific parsing logic.

**Example: Token balance formats**

| Provider | Balance format          | Decimals       |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Alchemy  | `"1000000000"` (string) | Separate field |
| Moralis  | `1000000000` (number)   | Separate field |
| Covalent | `"1000.00"` (formatted) | Included       |

**Uniblock normalized:**

```json
{
  "balance": "1000000000",
  "decimals": 6,
  "balanceFormatted": "1000.00"
}
```

All three formats are unified, so your code works regardless of which provider is used.

### Data consensus

For critical queries, Uniblock can query multiple providers simultaneously and return consensus data. This ensures accuracy and catches provider-specific bugs or stale data.

**When to use:**

- High-value transactions requiring verification
- Auditing and compliance scenarios
- Critical balance checks before transfers

**How it works:**

- Queries 2-3 providers in parallel
- Compares responses for consistency
- Returns data only if providers agree
- Flags discrepancies for investigation

<Warning>
  Data consensus increases latency and costs. Use it selectively for critical
  operations.
</Warning>

### Polyfilled data

Some providers have incomplete data for certain chains or time periods. Uniblock automatically detects gaps and fills them using alternative providers.

**Example scenarios:**

- Provider A has Ethereum data but missing Polygon data → Uniblock uses Provider B for Polygon
- Provider C has recent transactions but missing historical data → Uniblock backfills from Provider D
- Provider E returns incomplete NFT metadata → Uniblock enriches from Provider F

**Result:** You always get complete data without manual provider switching.

### Unified backup

If your primary provider experiences an outage, Uniblock seamlessly switches to backup providers without returning errors to your application.

**Failover chain example:**

1. Primary: Alchemy (fastest, most reliable)
2. Backup 1: QuickNode (high reliability)
3. Backup 2: Ankr (stable fallback)

**Typical failover time:** < 500ms

## Supported providers

Uniblock integrates with 20+ blockchain data providers to ensure comprehensive coverage and reliability, including: Alchemy, QuickNode, Infura, Ankr, Covalent, Moralis, Blockdaemon, Chainstack, TonAPI, Helius, and more.

## When to use Uniblock

### ✅ Use Uniblock when you need:

- **Multi-chain support** - Building apps that work across multiple blockchains
- **High reliability** - Production apps that can't tolerate provider outages
- **Consistent data** - Normalized formats across all providers and chains
- **Fast integration** - One API key instead of managing multiple providers
- **Cost optimization** - Automatic routing to most cost-effective providers

### ⚠️ Consider alternatives when:

- **Single provider is sufficient** - If you only need one chain and one provider, direct integration may be simpler
- **Extreme latency requirements** - Direct provider connections may be 50-100ms faster (though less reliable)

## Common pitfalls

<Warning>
  **Provider-specific features** - Some provider-specific endpoints or features
  may not be available through the unified API. Use [Direct
  API](/reference/direct-api/overview-direct-api) for provider-specific
  functionality.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Rate limits** - Rate limits apply per API key, not per provider. Monitor
  your usage in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.uniblock.dev) to avoid
  throttling.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **Chain ID consistency** - Always use numeric chain IDs (e.g., `1` for
  Ethereum) or official string identifiers (e.g., `solana`). Inconsistent chain
  IDs cause routing errors.
</Warning>
