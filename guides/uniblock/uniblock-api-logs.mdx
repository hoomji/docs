Here, we guide you through how Uniblock provides detailed logging and how you can access and interpret these logs for optimal API performance.

## Why API Logs Matter? 🧐

API logs offer visibility into the operation of your application. By analyzing API logs, you can:

- Identify and diagnose issues.
- Monitor API health and performance.
- Track user activity and patterns.
- Ensure security by detecting malicious activities.

Each log entry provides a number of requests made to external provider according to fallback list and the request detail of them:

- **Method**: the http request method, such as `GET` or `POST`.
- **Endpoint**: Which API endpoint was accessed.
- **Status**: Success or error status code.
- **Provider**: The provider that provided the final response.
- **Response**: The provider(s) responses that attempted the API call.
- **Response Time**: How long the API took to respond, also as known as latency.
- **Date**: The date and time when the request was made.

Clicking into a log entry provides in-depth log information for each API request to provide a transparent view into the interactions between your application and our system, as well as a series of requests attempted with external provider according to the fallback list. Here's a breakdown of the key components in our detailed logs for each request:

- **HTTP Method**: Such as `GET`, indicating the type of request made.

- **Endpoint Name**: A brief descriptor like `TokenMetadata` offering context on the purpose of the request.

- **Endpoint Path**: The specific path like `/v1/token/metadata` accessed on our servers.

- **Timestamp**: The exact time when the request was made.

- **Response Time**: Duration taken by our server to process and respond to the request.

- **Headers**: These are meta-data associated with the request. It includes various fields like:
  - `Host`: The domain making the request.
  - `User-Agent`: Information about the client system and browser.
  - `Accept`: The type of content expected in response.
  - ... and many others.

- **Query Parameters**: These are additional data sent with the request to provide context or specify a certain behavior.

- **Request Body**: The actual data sent in a `POST` or `PUT` request.

- **Response Headers & Body**: Meta-data and actual data returned from our provider(s) in response to the request. There may be multiple in the case that priority list gets engaged.
