## 1. Create an Uniblock Project 🦄

To use Uniblock's products, you need a project to authenticate your requests.

You can create a project from the dashboard. Follow the steps below to create a project:

1. First, navigate to your Uniblock's dashboard and click on the `Home` tab.

## 2. Make a request ✍️

Nice! You've made your project. Next you can interact with Uniblock's providers and also make a call to our endpoints.

1. Following from before, you can click on your project. To bring you to your project dashboard.

2. You will be present with your project home page like the following.

3. There are lots of things you can explore around and find out about but to call our endpoint you can click on the \``Endpoints` -> `API Tester` section on the left nav-bar.

4. A new tab will open to show the explorer where you can select an endpoint you like and try calling the endpoint. We will go with the `/token/metadata` endpoint.

6. Now we try to call this endpoint, by clicking the "Try it out" button.

9. Nice job! You've made your first call with Uniblock! 🎉

## 3. Get your Project API Key 🔑

You also can test calling the endpoint using your own API.

1. After you've created your project, you will find your API key on the `Overview` page.

![](/images/docs/dfa3a1d6dcc45e0e55c48513bd3e4fa7fe28819055dd9c7382aa86ae5d0626bb-1732206001424.png)

2. Add the key to the `Explorer`.

![](/images/docs/14a4b12e0c595880c1c41fd3d7dba8dd804bbb5e10a2fc6eeae46dd091baae9e-1732206273017.png) ![](/images/docs/1e4fc23c2d0610f347ed675f4e33e2a7a2797a22918fa318d39548c9afea7d61-1732206312150.png) ![](/images/docs/8f5299d8513ffa081e948b5263e0478cd4087fa6f20bbe430aed9385b5042cf4-1732206447762.png)

3. Now you are logged in with your API key. The data from the requests made using this key will be collected and displayed in the project metrics.

## 4. Setup Uniblock as your Client 🤝

Want to integrate Uniblock into your production app?

Find out how to set up or switch your current provider to Uniblock by using node js. An easy way to interact and use us.

1. From your command line, create a new project directory.

With Yarn:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash mkdir your-project-name cd your-project-name yarn init # (or yarn
  init --yes) ```
</CodeGroup>

With NPM:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash mkdir your-project-name cd your-project-name npm init # (or npm
  init --yes) ```
</CodeGroup>

2. Create a file named index.js and add the following contents:

<Info>### You should replace demo with your Uniblock's Project API key.</Info>

index.js

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  const options = {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      accept: 'application/json',
      'X-API-KEY': 'demo-api-key'
    }
  };

fetch('https://api.uniblock.dev/uni/v1/token/balance?chainId=1&walletAddress=0x3f5ce5fbfe3e9af3971dd833d26ba9b5c936f0be', options)
.then(response => response.json())
.then(response => console.log(response))
.catch(err => console.error(err));

````
</CodeGroup>

3. Run it using node

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
node index.js
````

</CodeGroup>

4. You should now see the latest token/balance output in your console!

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
    "balances": [
      {
        "contractAddress": "0x0000000000095413afc295d19edeb1ad7b71c952",
        "balance": "100000000000000000000"
      },
      {
        "contractAddress": "0x0000000035f26e72b70552b92bf7e02f67a90549",
        "balance": "20000000000000000000000000"
      },
      {
        "contractAddress": "0x00000006e55a9364b657e3b91cd0411b4fd11ac2",
        "balance": "20082049953158728210968860"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "cursor": "ALC_0x09a3ecafa817268f77be1283176b946c4ff2e608"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
