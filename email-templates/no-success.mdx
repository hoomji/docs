Hi {{first_name}},

You've created a project, but we haven't seen a successful request yet. Let's fix that.

### Common issues

Most setup issues come down to one of these:

- **Authentication errors** — API key not included or formatted incorrectly
- **Wrong endpoint or chain** — Double-check you're using the right network
- **Missing headers** — Make sure `Content-Type: application/json` is set

### Quick checklist

Before making your next request, verify:

- ✓ API key is added to the request header
- ✓ You're targeting the correct blockchain network
- ✓ Request format matches our examples

### Try this example

Here's a working request you can copy and paste:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.unblock.com/v1/chains \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual key from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.unblock.com).
