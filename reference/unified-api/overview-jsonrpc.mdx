<Info>
  Remember to create your project & get your API-KEY through our [Uniblock's
  dashboard](https://dashboard.uniblock.dev).
</Info>

JSON-RPC is a protocol used to communicate with blockchain nodes, enabling both read and write operations. They have a JSON-RPC interface for read requests.

Uniblock's JSON-RPC implementation adds in our AI router to help route your request to the best provider based on reliability, latency and cost. With features like automated fallback and auto retry, we try to make sure your request will not fail.

## Supported JSON-RPC Chains

For more details on our JSON-RPC service, head to our [JSON-RPC chains](/reference/resources/chains/supported-json-rpc-chains) page for our comprehensive mapping of supported chains and methods.

Also, please checkout our [chains tab](/reference/jsonrpc-docs/1/ethereum-overview) for a list of the supported methods by chain with detailed request examples to test live on our docs.

## Quickstart

#### Key JSON-RPC Methods

Some common JSON-RPC methods available on Ethereum nodes include:

- `eth_blockNumber`
- `eth_getBalance`
- `eth_getBlockByNumber`
- `eth_sendRawTransaction` (for write operations)

### JSON-RPC Request Example

A typical JSON-RPC request to get the balance of an address looks like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json 
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getBalance",
    "params": ["0xAddress", "latest"],
    "id": 1
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

- `jsonrpc`: Version (always 2.0)
- `method`: The method to call
- `params`: Relevant parameters
- `id`: Request identifier

### JSON-RPC Response Example

A response to the above request might look like this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": "0x7cf7d42bb6a906",
    "id": 1
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

- `jsonrpc`: Mirrored version (2.0)
- `result`: The balance in wei
- `id`: Request identifier

## Tester

Uniblock's dashboard also has a built in JSON-RPC tester that can be used to test our supported JSON-RPC methods across our chains.
