Unified API's primary goal is to provide users with a one stop place for integrating blockchain functionality into applications with reliability, latency, and cost in mind.

<Info>
  Remember to create your project & get your API-KEY through our [Uniblock's
  dashboard](https://dashboard.uniblock.dev).
</Info>

The provided endpoints in Unified API offer a variety of functionalities related to tokens (both fungible and non-fungible), and transactions, across multiple blockchains. The endpoints can be filtered by these categories:

## Token API

These endpoints provide functionalities related to fungible tokens (like ERC20). You can retrieve metadata about a token, query a specific address's balance, track token transactions, and query for token allowances.
