<Info>
  Remember to create your project & get your API-KEY through our [Uniblock's
  dashboard](http://dashboard.uniblock.dev).
</Info>

Webhooks let you receive real-time notifications from Unified API whenever specific blockchain events occur, without needing to poll endpoints. They automatically send signed HTTP POST requests to your server for events like transactions, token transfers, NFTs, and new blocks, enabling fast and reliable event-driven workflows.

## Webhook Setup

Navigate to the `Webhooks` section in Uniblock dashboard. You will notice a `Create Webhook` button which expands a section for creating a new webhook.

Follow the four steps to deploy a webhook.

1. Add webhook information.

   1. Give this webhook a name and a description that are only for labelling purposes in Uniblock Dashboard.
   2. Fill the webhook URL. Send a test request to the URL by hitting the `Test` button.

2. Select provider and network.

   1. Select a provider to deploy the webhook with. Each provider has its own list of supported network.
   2. Select a network to deploy the webhook on.

3. Select a webhook template.

   1. Custom Webhook. It has great flexibility. You will need to fill out the whole set of required fields.
   2. Webhook Templates, They are pre-defined templates to help quickly fill the webhook information, such as contract address of a popular token and ABI.

4. Add events and filters. This step further defines what kind of specific blockchain state changes that you would like to listen.

   1. For address activity webhook, you can setup transaction filters.

   2. For contract event webhook, you can setup event filters. Selecting an event is required, but adding event filter is optional.

   3. For solana address activity webhook, you can setup solana transaction filters.

5. Deploy webhook. Once the webhook is deployed, you will be able to view the new webhook in the active webhook list.

- Consider implementing security measures to validate incoming webhook requests and protect your data.
