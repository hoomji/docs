### Transaction Filter Fields

| Field           | Description                                 | Operator                  | Value                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sender          | Address sending the tokens                  | ==, !=, in, not in, regex | Enter specific address(es) or use patterns like "0x\*" for all addresses starting with 0x |
| receiver        | Address receiving the tokens                | ==, !=, in, not in, regex | Enter specific address(es) or use patterns                                                |
| blockNumber     | Block number where the transaction occurred | ==, >, \<, >=, \<=, !=    | Specify the exact block number or use operators for comparisons                           |
| transactionHash | Transaction hash unique to the event        | ==, !=                    | Enter the specific transaction hash                                                       |

**Value:**

- Enter specific values, comma-separated lists for "in" and "not in" operators, or regular expressions for regex matching.

**Example:**

To receive notifications only when your wallet address (0x123abc...) receives tokens from a sender (0x987cdf...), add your wallet address to the addresses and set up the following filter:

- `sender == 0x987cdf...`

This ensures you're only notified about transfers on your wallet with a specific sender (0x987cdf...).
