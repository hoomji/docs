Trigger Actions upon Specific Contract Events.

This allows you to track custom events emitted by smart contracts you're interested in. Requires specifying the contract address and the event.

Contract Event is a custom webhook type offering great flexibility, while the other webhook types are built on top of this webhook type with prefilled contract address and ABI for specific purposes and serve as templates.

### Event Filter Fields

| Field                             | Description                                                                                                   | Operator                  | Value                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| topic0 (required)                 | The event to listen to. The event must be defined in the ABI.                                                 | ==                        | Match specific event string in the ABI. |
| topic1, topic2, topic3 (optional) | The inputs of the event (indexed parameters) that are defined in the ABI. Up to 3 inputs filters are allowed. | ==, !=, in, not in, regex | Match specific type of the event input. |

**Value:**

- Enter specific values, comma-separated lists for "in" and "not in" operators, or regular expressions for regex matching.

**Example:**

Assume you're interested in tracking a specific "Approval" event that approves to a spender (0x123abc...) within a smart contract. To receive notifications only when such Approval event occurs, set up the following filters:

- `topic0 == "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"` (the topic hash that represents an ApprovalApproval)
- `topic2 == "0x123abc..."`(spender is the second input defined in the ABI inputs for this event)

This ensures you're only notified about relevant approval within the smart contract, allowing you to stay informed about the community activity.
