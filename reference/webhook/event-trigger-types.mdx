Webhook enables users to subscribe to event notifications within their application. By creating a webhook, users can receive notifications for various types of on-chain activities.

The following outlines the types of webhooks available and the networks they support. Look to our examples in order to see how you can implement each type.

## Custom Webhooks

| Custom Webhook                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                          | Network                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| [Address Activity](ref:event-trigger-address-activity)               | The Address Activity webhook tracks all ETH, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 transfers, enabling real-time state changes when an address sends or receives tokens or ETH. | All supported EVM chains |
| [Contract Event](ref:event-trigger-contract-event)                   | This allows you to track custom events emitted by smart contracts you're interested in. Requires specifying the contract address, ABI and event name.                | All supported EVM chains |
| [Solana Address Activity](ref:event-trigger-solana-address-activity) | Create a webhook to receive real-time notifications for state changes specifically on Solana network.                                                                | Solana                   |

## Webhook Templates

There are webhook templates with prefilled values on top of the custom webhook types for quick webhook deployment.

| Template                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Network                                                                                                                                                       |

| NFT Events                  | The NFT Events webhook enables you to track transfers of ERC721 NFTs, triggering real-time events when an NFT is sent or received from an address. This is built on top of the Contract Event webhook type with prefilled ERC721 ABI.                                                  | All supported EVM chains                                                                                                                                      |
| NFT Collection Events       | The NFT Collection webhook enables you to track ERC1155 token contracts, triggering real-time events when an NFT is transferred between addresses.
