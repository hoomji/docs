The provided endpoints in the Unified API offer a variety of functionalities related to tokens (both fungible and non-fungible), and transactions, across multiple blockchains. The endpoints can be filtered by categories, chains and providers and they include:

# Categories

## Blockchain Endpoints:

These endpoints provide core blockchain functionalities. They enable users to access data directly from various blockchains, such as block details, the latest blocks mined, and blockchain statistics. Useful for developers looking to integrate blockchain data into their applications.

## MarketData Endpoints:

These endpoints deliver real-time and historical market data from multiple exchanges. Access information such as cryptocurrency price quotes, market capitalization, trading volumes, and exchange rate data. Essential for financial analyses and trading strategies. Learn more about these endpoints on our [MarketData](ref:api-overview-market-data) page.

## Scans Endpoints:

These endpoints allow for scanning blockchain networks for particular transactions, addresses, or blocks. Useful for monitoring network activity, detecting anomalies, and auditing transaction histories. Learn more about these endpoints on our [Scan](ref:api-overview-scan) page.

## Smart Contract Endpoints:

These endpoints facilitate the deployment, interaction, and querying of smart contracts on supported blockchains. Users can create, execute, and manage smart contracts, as well as fetch contract state and logs. Learn more about these endpoints on our [Unified Contracts](ref:unified-contract-overview) page.

## Token API Endpoints:

These endpoints provide functionalities related to fungible tokens (like ERC20). You can retrieve metadata about a token, query a specific address's balance, fetch the current market price, track token transactions, and understand allowances (how much one address is allowed to spend on behalf of another). Learn more about these endpoints on our [Token](ref:token) page.

## NFT API Endpoints:

These endpoints are related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs, like ERC721 or ERC1155). These endpoints allow you to check the NFT balance of an address, retrieve detailed information about NFTs in a collection, track NFT transactions, and fetch metadata about NFTs or NFT collections. Start fetching with our endpoints shown on our [NFT](ref:nft-1) page.

## Transaction API Endpoints:

These endpoints focus on blockchain transactions. They enable you to retrieve a list of transactions related to a specific address and obtain detailed information about a particular transaction. Retrieve using our endpoints on the [Transaction](ref:transaction-1) page.

## Wallet Endpoints:

These endpoints assist in managing and querying cryptocurrency wallets. Features include generating new wallet addresses, retrieving wallet balances, and signing transactions. Ideal for developing secure and functional crypto wallets.

## Stellar Endpoint

These endpoints give access to Stellar Horizon Rest API for stellar mainnet and testnet. Learn more about these endpoints at [Stellar HTTP](https://docs.uniblock.dev/reference/stellarhttp).

## Direct API Endpoints:

Direct API is an evolution of the existing passthrough V1 endpoint offered in the Unified API, which provides a way for users to call any endpoint in a list of supported providers. This endpoint serves as a flexible solution, enabling direct interaction with third-party APIs through a single, unified interface. Learn more about these endpoints on our [Direct API](ref:overview-direct-api) page.
