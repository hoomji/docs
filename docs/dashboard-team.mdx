## Assigning Roles to Users

Uniblock allows you to assign different roles to users, defining their access level and capabilities within the project. You are allowed to add/remove team member of as high as your own role level. The available roles are:

- **Owner**: Has full access and control over the project.
- **Admin**: Has access to most of the project's sections, but some permissions may be restricted.
- **User**: Has limited access, ideal for members who only need to view or perform specific tasks.

To change a user's role:

1. Find the user in your Users tab list.

2. Click on the **edit** button next to their name.

3. Select the desired role from the dropdown list and save your changes.

## Removing Users from your Project

Should a team member no longer be part of your project, you can easily remove them from your Users list.

1. Locate the user in your Users tab list.

2. Click on the **delete** button next to their name.

Please use this function with caution as it will completely remove the user and their access to your project.
