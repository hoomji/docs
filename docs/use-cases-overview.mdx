## ICO Launches 🚀

Uniblock's Launcher supports ERC20 tokens, enabling you to create your very own digital assets.

You can use this functionality to launch your own token, or even to set up an entire platform that supports a wide range of token drops and project proposals

- Build an ICO drop platform, where users of the platform can submit project proposals and token drops to be displayed on the ICO drop platform.
- Deploy an ERC20 token to enable holders to participate in the drops
- Launch new ERC20 tokens for each drop, and kickstart sales🎉

## Decentralized Finance Platforms 💱

Developers building DeFi platforms can leverage the Unified API's token endpoints to manage the tokens on their platforms. Unified API offers a tailored configuration of providers and a seamless switch-over to backup providers ensuring uninterrupted service. Key operations include fetching token metadata, retrieving token balances, obtaining token prices, listing token transfers, and inspecting token allowances. These operations are integral to tasks such as wallet creation, user balance management, and transaction execution.

The Launcher's base contracts can be utilized for native token creation. Typically, DeFi platforms might opt for ERC20 smart contracts for minting fungible tokens that serve as the platform's main currency. The ERC20 Presale extension smart contract can be deployed for the preliminary distribution of these tokens. The forthcoming staking extension promises to extend functionalities to include token staking and reward disbursement 💎.

Enhance your platform's capabilities by integrating with Quicknode, Moralis, Alchemy and other RPC providers for added features such as fetching wallet details and transaction data.

## NFT Marketplace 🎨

For developers building NFT marketplaces, the Unified API's NFT endpoints offer functionalities to manage NFTs. With Unified API, you get the flexibility of custom provider configurations and the assurance of provider backup for consistent performance. This includes our endpoints for retrieving NFT balances, pulling specific NFTs from a collection, listing NFT transfers, and accessing collection metadata.

Use the ERC721 base contract for minting unique NFTs, and the Marketplace extension for establishing sale or auction mechanisms. ThirdWeb contracts provide the means to curate NFT collections or erect marketplaces🏗️.

Further refine your platform by integrating with Alchemy and Covalent to gather detailed NFT and transaction data.

## Gaming Platforms 🎮

Game developers can take advantage of the Unified API's Token and NFT endpoints to manage in-game assets.

The ERC1155 base contract is especially handy as it allows multiple token types within a single contract, perfect for in-game currencies (fungible) and unique game items or characters (non-fungible) 👾.

The Multisend extension contract offers a means to distribute rewards or items to multiple players simultaneously.

Integrating with Alchemy, Covalent, Moralis and other RPC providers can supplement your game with a rich dataset for improved game services 📈.

## Airdrop Campaigns 🪂

For developers managing airdrop campaigns, the Unified API's Token and NFT endpoints provide functionalities to manage assets and monitor distribution.

The ERC20 Airdrop contract extension can streamline the creation and management of airdrop campaigns. The Multisend extension facilitates simultaneous token distribution to multiple addresses 💌.

## DAOs ⚖️

For DAO developers, the Token endpoints of the Unified API can be harnessed to manage governance tokens. Unified API adds an extra layer of dependability with its built-in provider fallbacks.

DAOs can employ ERC20 or ERC721 contracts based on their governance token needs, whether fungible or non-fungible. ERC1155 contracts offer a solution for more complex governance structures, accommodating multiple types of governance tokens within a single contract.

The upcoming Vote contract under ThirdWeb Contracts presents a turnkey solution for incorporating voting mechanisms in DAOs 📮.

Integrating with Moralis, Alchemy, Covalent and other RPC providers ensures access to comprehensive transaction data and token information, a necessity for robust, transparent governance.

## Wallets 🏦

As one of the largest dApp categories, some of the most popular products are the wallets, including Metamask, Trustwallet, Argent, and more

Uniblock APIs can be used to back the required data, and integrated packages can aid in supporting the swapping and transactions.

You can use Uniblock APIs to monitor user balances . You can employ Uniblock's Uniswap package to facilitate trading as exchanges 💹.
