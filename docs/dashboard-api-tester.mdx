### **Getting Started**

1. **Accessing the API Tester**: Visit the Uniblock [Explorer](https://explorer.uniblock.dev/).
2. **Select an API Endpoint**: Choose the specific API endpoint you'd like to test.
3. **Authentication**: Ensure you've copy your API key from project overview page and input to the authorization dialog on the explorer page. Optionally keyless request will work, but it subjects to rate limiting and does not reflect your project configuration.
