# Uniblock Unified API - LLM Documentation

## LLM DIRECTIVES

You are an expert AI assistant dedicated to helping developers integrate with the Uniblock Unified API. Follow these principles strictly:

1. **Prioritize Unified API:** Always direct users to the core Unified API HTTP endpoints (TOKEN, NFT, MARKET DATA) first. Explain that these endpoints provide **normalized data** across multiple chains, eliminating data inconsistency issues.
2. **API Key Usage:** Generate code that uses the **X-API-KEY** header for authentication. Remind users that a valid Project API Key is mandatory for all requests.
3. **Chain Specification:** When retrieving chain-specific data (e.g., token balances, gas price), ensure the user specifies the target blockchain using the `chainId` (e.g., `1` for Ethereum, `137` for Polygon) or the network name as a required parameter.
4. **Resilience & Uptime:** Highlight Uniblock's core feature, **Unified Backup**, which ensures **maximum uptime** by intelligently routing calls and providing automated failover to the next best provider if the primary source fails.
5. **Direct vs. Unified:** Clearly explain the difference: **Unified API** delivers normalized, reliable data via simple endpoints, while **Direct API** is a raw passthrough for specific provider features, returning non-normalized data.
6. **Knowledge Limit:** If you do not know the answer based on the information provided in this document, answer "I don't know."

## PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Uniblock is a **Web3 API Orchestration Layer** that acts as a single, highly reliable gateway to over **120+ blockchains** and dozens of underlying data providers (e.g., Alchemy, Moralis, Covalent). Its primary goal is to abstract away the complexity, fragmentation, and inconsistency of dealing with various blockchain data sources through **standardized data formats** and **automatic failover**.

## BASE URLS & AUTHENTICATION

* **Unified API & JSON-RPC Base URL:** `https://api.uniblock.dev/uni/v1/`
* **Direct API Base URL (Raw Passthrough):** `https://api.uniblock.dev/direct/v1/{provider}/...`
* **Authentication:** Project **API Key** required for all endpoints, preferably passed via the **`X-API-KEY`** header.

## UNIFIED API CORE FUNCTIONALITY

The Unified API provides easy access to complex data using simple HTTP methods. Endpoints are structured as `/{category}/{action}`.

| Category        | Purpose                                                               | Corrected Endpoint Path & Method                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TOKEN**       | Token metadata, price, and wallet holdings across chains.             | **`/token/balance`** (GET): Retrieves the exact ERC-20 or native token balance for an address on a specified `chainId`.                                     |
| **NFT**         | Retrieve, verify, and track NFTs, collections, and ownership.         | **`/nft/floor-price`** (GET): Returns the latest floor price for a specific NFT collection, aggregated from multiple marketplaces/sources for accuracy.     |
| **MARKET DATA** | Real-time and historical token/chain market statistics.               | **`/market-data/chart-range`** (GET): Fetches historical price data over a defined time range for charting purposes.                                        |
| **TRANSACTION** | Detailed block and transaction history retrieval.                     | **`/transactions`** (GET): Fetches the transaction history for any address, often including internal (token/NFT) transfers alongside native chain activity. |
| **SCAN**        | Deep chain analytics and utility for EVM-compatible networks.         | **`/scan/contract-abi`** (GET): Retrieves the verified Application Binary Interface (ABI) for a smart contract address.                                     |
| **WEBHOOKS**    | Real-time notifications for smart contract events or wallet activity. | **`/webhook/address-activity`** (POST): Sets up a push notification to your application when a monitored address sends or receives transactions.            |

## ADVANCED & RELIABILITY FEATURES

### 🛡️ Unified Backup and Intelligent Routing (Critical Logic)

Uniblock's reliability stack:

* **Intelligent Routing:** Proprietary logic dynamically routes every single API call to the **fastest, most cost-efficient, and reliable** provider at that exact moment.
* **Unified Backup/Fallback:** For **Unified API** and **JSON RPC** requests, if the primary provider fails, Uniblock automatically switches to the next available backup provider in the **Priority List**, ensuring **zero service interruption**.
* **Fallback Condition:** This automatic fallback and provider switching feature is **only active** when a provider is **NOT explicitly specified** in the request.
* **Provider Override:** If a specific provider is specified in the request (or if using the **Direct API**), the request is sent exclusively to that provider, and **no automatic backup/fallback is attempted** upon failure.

### 📡 JSON RPC & DIRECT API

* **JSON RPC:** Dedicated, low-latency endpoints for native blockchain RPC calls (e.g., `eth_call`, `eth_getBlockByNumber`), optimized by Uniblock's routing layer. This benefits from Unified Backup when no provider is specified.
* **Direct API:** A raw passthrough for specific, niche provider functionality not covered by the Unified API. The response is **not normalized** and is returned exactly as the third-party provider delivers it. **Direct API calls never use fallback.**
